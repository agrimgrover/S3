= Adding a new backend

One of Zenko's Cloudserver commitment is to simplify multicloud storage by
giving one API (the S3 API) to access all clouds. With that in mind, supporting
more and more backends is one of Zenko's Community priorities. And you, as a
developer, are welcome to join that trend!

If you're planning to add a new backend for your own usage, go ahead and read
the doc. If you have any questions during the development process, search our
https://forum.scality.com[forum] and, if there is no answer to your question
already there, open a new thread.

//TODO: Add link to contributing Guidelines
If you're planning to contribute your backend support to our official
repository, please follow these steps:
- familiarize yourself with our Contributing Guidelines;
- open a Github issue and fill out Feature Request form, and specify you would
like to contribute it yourself;
- wait for our core team to get back to you with an answer on whether we are
interested in taking that contribution in (and hence committing to maintaining
it over time);
- once approved, fork this https://www.github.com/scality/S3[repository], and
get started!
- reach out to us on the https://forum.scality.com[forum] with any question you
may have during the development process (after reading this document, of
course!);
- when you think it's ready, let us know so that we create a feature branch
against which we'll compare and review your code;
- open a pull request with your changes against that dedicated feature branch;
//TODO: Add Hall of Fame section in the community report
- once that pull request gets merged, you're done (and you'll join our Hall of
Fame ;) );
- finally, we'll let you know when we merge this into master.

TIP: While we do take care of the final rebase (when we merge your feature
     branch on master), we do ask that you keep up to date with our master until
     then; find out more https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/[here].

IMPORTANT: If we do not approve your feature request, you may of course still
           work on supporting a new backend: all our "no" means is that we do
           not have the resources, as part of our core development team, to
           maintain this feature for the moment.
           _If your code is clean and your extension works nicely, we will be_
           _glad to advertise it as part of the Zenko Galaxy_

//TODO: Get approval for Zenko Galaxy as the name of our hub - sound appropriate with Orbit ;)

There are two main types of backend you could want Zenko to support:

== link:NON_S3_COMPATIBLE_BACKENDS.adoc[Data backends using another protocol than the S3 protocol]
